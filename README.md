# Jonas' attempt at the "Project Euler" challenges.
I completed the challenges from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) in different programming languages as a fun learning-sideproject.

The project was constructed inside a [VS-Code devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and will install all extensions and dependancies automatically upon building this container.

To run these files, use the command `racket Lang_Racket/*.rkt`, or use the [DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org) Programming Environment.

## Ruby
These solutions where written in [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org).
